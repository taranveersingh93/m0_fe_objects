# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
` Felt comfortable.`
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
`I do majorly everything after the class. It's going well. I stay focused.`
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
`A minor thing that could haunt me(or anyone) someday would be missing the uppercase in "Object" someday and not picking up on it despite the error in output.`
